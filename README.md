# replace
Simple command line tool to rename all files in a directory by extension with given substring and replacer

# Installation
## Go SDK (recommended)
If you already have `go` installed, you can easily just clone the repository and run `go install`. Go will compile and install the project for you. The executable will be located in `~/go/bin`, so make sure the folder is inside your PATH (it automatically should be on Windows).  
You can dwonload the Go SDK [here](https://go.dev/dl/).
